# Resource Integration Tests Summary

## Overview
Created comprehensive integration tests for the newly added resource files as requested in the QA review.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `/tests/resource-loading-integration.test.js`
This test file verifies that all new resources load correctly and have proper structure:

- **Task Resources Tests**
  - Verifies `tasks/update-working-memory.yaml` loads with correct structure
  - Verifies `tasks/retrieve-context.yaml` loads with correct structure
  - Checks all required fields (id, name, type, category, priority, etc.)

- **Utility Resources Tests**  
  - Verifies `utils/update-working-memory.yaml` configuration
  - Verifies `utils/retrieve-context.yaml` configuration
  - Verifies `utils/validate-next-story.yaml` configuration
  - Checks implementation references and exports

- **Structured Task Resources Tests**
  - Verifies all three structured task YAML files load correctly
  - Validates complex structures like steps, inputs, outputs
  - Ensures metadata and validation criteria are present

- **Cross-Reference Validation Tests**
  - Ensures task references to structured tasks resolve correctly
  - Ensures utility references to structured tasks resolve correctly
  - Verifies all implementation JavaScript files exist

- **Resource Consistency Tests**
  - Verifies IDs match filenames
  - Ensures naming conventions are followed
  - Validates reference integrity

### 2. `/tests/resource-usage-integration.test.js`
This test file verifies resources work together as an integrated system:

- **Memory Management Integration**
  - Tests complete chain: task → structured task → utility → implementation
  - Verifies ID consistency across related resources
  - Checks category alignment

- **Story Validation Integration**
  - Tests validate-next-story resource chain
  - Verifies configuration paths and settings
  - Ensures all exports are properly defined

- **Resource Dependencies**
  - Validates Qdrant configuration for memory retrieval
  - Validates memory lifecycle configuration
  - Validates story validation configuration

- **Structured Task Validation**
  - Ensures validation criteria exist
  - Verifies example usage is provided
  - Validates complex step structures

- **Cross-Resource Compatibility**
  - Ensures consistent input/output naming
  - Verifies all resources follow naming conventions
  - Tests compatibility between related resources

## Resources Tested

1. **Tasks**
   - `bmad-core/structured-tasks/update-working-memory.yaml`
   - `bmad-core/structured-tasks/retrieve-context.yaml`

2. **Utilities**
   - `bmad-core/utils/update-working-memory.yaml`
   - `bmad-core/utils/retrieve-context.yaml`
   - `bmad-core/utils/validate-next-story.yaml`

3. **Structured Tasks**
   - `bmad-core/structured-tasks/update-working-memory.yaml`
   - `bmad-core/structured-tasks/retrieve-context.yaml`
   - `bmad-core/structured-tasks/validate-next-story.yaml`

## Issues Fixed During Testing

1. **YAML Format Issue**: Fixed invalid YAML structure in `tasks/retrieve-context.yaml` where array items had object-like syntax
2. **Path Resolution**: Adjusted test expectations to match actual relative path structures

## Test Results

✅ All 24 tests passing across both test suites
- 13 tests in resource-loading-integration.test.js
- 11 tests in resource-usage-integration.test.js

## Coverage Achieved

The tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Resource loading and parsing
- Structure validation
- Reference integrity
- Cross-resource compatibility
- Configuration validation
- Naming conventions
- Integration between related resources

These tests ensure that the new resources will:
1. Load correctly in the BMad system
2. Have all required fields and proper structure
3. Reference each other correctly
4. Work together as an integrated system
5. Follow established conventions and patterns
