## Critical Issues Found

### =4 CRITICAL: Missing Dependency Module
**File:** `/Users/I560101/Project-Sat/SEMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/utils/memory-hygiene.js`  
**Lines:** 10-11  
**Issue:** References undefined modules `memory-summarizer` and `memory-config`
```javascript
const { createSessionSummary } = require('./memory-summarizer');
const { getWorkingMemoryPath, MEMORY_CONFIG } = require('./memory-config');
```
**Impact:** Runtime errors will occur when memory hygiene is triggered
**Fix Required:** Ensure these utility modules exist or update import paths

### =4 CRITICAL: Hardcoded Configuration Path
**File:** `/Users/I560101/Project-Sat/SEMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/utils/memory-hygiene.js`  
**Lines:** 27-28  
**Issue:** Uses synchronous fs.readFileSync and hardcoded path
```javascript
const configPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'bmad-core', 'core-config.yaml');
const configContent = require('fs').readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8');
```
**Impact:** Will fail in different working directories or deployment scenarios
**Fix Required:** Use configurable paths or follow existing configuration loading patterns

### =� MAJOR: Potential Race Condition
**File:** `/Users/I560101/Project-Sat/SEMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/utils/agent-memory-manager.js`  
**Lines:** 265-274  
**Issue:** Memory hygiene runs asynchronously with setImmediate() without proper error handling
```javascript
setImmediate(async () => {
  try {
    const shouldRun = await shouldRunMemoryHygiene(agentName, 'action');
    // ...
  } catch (hygieneError) {
    console.warn(`Memory hygiene failed for ${agentName}:`, hygieneError.message);
  }
});
```
**Impact:** Silent failures possible, concurrent memory access issues
**Fix Required:** Implement proper async handling or queuing mechanism

## Code Quality Assessment
