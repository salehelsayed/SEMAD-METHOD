**A few points to double‑check:**

1 **Ensure the package file actually reflects the changes**—the copy I reviewed still lists only front‑end dependencies.  Without Ajv and a `validate:contracts` script, the new validation script won’t run via npm.  Make sure the final repository moves Ajv to `dependencies` and adds the script.

2 **Task runner compatibility:** The actions specified in `validate-story-contract.yaml` (`file:read`, `yaml:extract-frontmatter`, etc.) assume the task runner has these built‑in handlers.  If your runner doesn’t support them yet, you’ll need to implement or map them.

3 **Schema resolution in all scripts:** `validate-story-contract.js` now uses `ModuleResolver`, but other scripts might still rely on hard‑coded paths.  Align them to use the same resolution strategy.

Overall, the key gaps raised in the previous review—YAML front‑matter extraction, namespaced actions, early validation, and package scripts—have been addressed.  Once the npm dependencies are finalised and the task runner can execute the namespaced actions, the automated contract validation and test alignment pipeline should work smoothly.
