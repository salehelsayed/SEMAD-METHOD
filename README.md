SEMAD-METHOD is an enhanced fork of the BMad-Method framework that introduces structured engineering practices to multi-agent AI development. This fork focuses on reducing hallucination, improving agent reliability, and ensuring deterministic behavior through YAML/JSON-based task definitions, structured memory systems, and formal contract specifications.

## üöÄ Key Improvements in SEMAD-METHOD

This fork introduces eight major improvements over the original BMad-Method:

### 1. **Structured Tasks & Checklists (YAML/JSON)**
- **What Changed**: Converted all free-form Markdown tasks to structured YAML format with explicit schemas
- **Why**: Eliminates ambiguity and LLM interpretation errors
- **Impact**: Deterministic task execution with validation support
- **Files**: All tasks in `bmad-core/structured-tasks/`, validated by schemas in `bmad-core/schemas/`

### 2. **Simple Task Tracking System**
- **What Changed**: Added lightweight task tracking for agent workflows
- **Why**: Ensures systematic completion of all tasks without missing items
- **Impact**: Agents can track progress through complex multi-step operations
- **Implementation**: In-memory tracking with `.ai/` directory for persistence, simple file-based logging
- **Key Files**: `simple-task-tracker.js` for workflow tracking, `track-progress.js` for persistent observations

### 3. **Dynamic Plan Adaptation**
- **What Changed**: Automatic task decomposition for complex operations
- **Why**: Prevents monolithic processing of large instruction sets
- **Impact**: Better handling of complex tasks through divide-and-conquer approach
- **Files**: `bmad-core/tools/dynamic-planner.js`, `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dynamic-plan-rules.yaml`

### 4. **Automated Search Tools Generation**
- **What Changed**: PRD-driven search query generation for documentation retrieval
- **Why**: Improves context by automatically identifying needed external resources
- **Impact**: Agents have access to relevant documentation during development
- **Usage**: `npm run generate:search-tools`

### 5. **StoryContract Specification**
- **What Changed**: Formal contract blocks in story files replacing prose summaries
- **Why**: Eliminates hallucination between PRD and story creation
- **Impact**: Developers work from structured specifications, not interpretations
- **Schema**: `bmad-core/schemas/story-contract-schema.json`

### 6. **Contract-Driven Development**
- **What Changed**: Dev agent uses StoryContract as single source of truth
- **Why**: Prevents implementation drift from requirements
- **Impact**: Direct traceability from requirements to implementation

### 7. **Comprehensive Validation System**
- **What Changed**: JSON Schema validation for all artifacts
- **Why**: Catches errors before they propagate through the workflow
- **Impact**: Build-time validation ensures quality
- **Scripts**: `npm run validate`, `scripts/validate-all.js`

### 8. **Enhanced Testing & Error Handling**
- **What Changed**: Complete test coverage with 284 passing tests
- **Why**: Ensures reliability across all components
- **Impact**: Production-ready system with deterministic behavior
- **Status**: 100% test pass rate achieved

### 9. **Dev‚ÜîQA Iterative Flow Option** *(New)*
- **What Changed**: Added choice between linear Dev‚ÜíQA flow and iterative Dev‚ÜîQA loop
- **Why**: Different projects need different quality assurance approaches
- **Impact**: Teams can choose immediate iteration on QA findings or batch processing
- **Usage**: `npm run orchestrate` or configure in `.bmad-workflow.yaml`

## üìä Results

These improvements have transformed BMad-Method into a production-ready system:
- **Test Coverage**: 284 tests, 100% passing
- **Agent Reliability**: 16/16 agent connectivity tests passing
- **Dependency Management**: All 135 dependencies validated and working
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Structured contracts eliminate interpretation errors
- **Task Tracking**: Simple, reliable progress tracking ensures nothing gets missed

## Overview

**SEMAD-METHOD builds on BMad's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Structured Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. SEMAD enhances this with structured YAML tasks, simple task tracking, and dynamic plan adaptation to ensure consistent, hallucination-free planning.

**2. Contract-Driven Development:** The Scrum Master agent transforms detailed plans into structured StoryContract specifications embedded in development stories. SEMAD's formal contract system ensures Dev agents work from explicit specifications, not interpretations, eliminating implementation drift.

**3. Validated Engineering Workflow:** Every artifact - from tasks to stories to implementations - is validated against formal schemas. Combined with comprehensive testing (284 tests, 100% passing), SEMAD ensures production-ready reliability.

This enhanced approach eliminates **planning inconsistency**, **context loss**, and **hallucination** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with a formal contract specification and complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

## Reverse‚ÄëAlign MVP Quickstart

- Generate dependency report (reachability, cycles, forbidden):
  - `npm run dep:report`
- Refresh manifest (single source of truth):
  - `npm run reverse:manifest`
- Generate docs from evidence (G‚ÄëPRD/G‚ÄëARCH shards under `docs/*.generated/`):
  - `npm run reverse:align`
- Generate a capped list of StoryCandidates (non-destructive):
  - `npm run reverse:stories`
- Normalize existing stories (ensures StoryContract frontmatter; preserves prose):
  - `npm run reverse:normalize`
- Enforce coverage + delta-only drift gate:
  - `npm run reverse:gate`
- Validate golden outputs locally (structural checks):
  - `npm run reverse:validate`

Config Quickstart:
- Suppress dynamic imports/false-positives: edit `.ai/extractor-suppress.json`
- Ignore noisy StoryCandidates: edit `.ai/story-ignore.json`
- Require 100% coverage for critical items: edit `.ai/critical-entities.json`

Quality Gate Controls:
- Default coverage threshold: `0.85` (override via `reverse:gate` args or workflow inputs)
- Delta-only baseline: computed from the PR base ref in CI; first run is advisory if baseline missing

## Monorepo Notes (Lightweight)

- Entry points: run `npm run dep:report` at the repo root first. For large workspaces, also run per package:
  - `node scripts/generate-dep-report.js packages/app-one packages/lib-core` (roots override)
- Common excludes (already configured in `.dependency-cruiser.js`):
  - `node_modules/`, `dist/`, test folders: `**/__tests__/**`, `**/tests/**`
- Recommendations:
  - Keep suppress globs tight (avoid `**/*`); prefer `**/generated/**`, `**/__mocks__/**`, `**/legacy/**`.
  - If a package is mostly docs/assets, omit it from `dep:report` roots to reduce noise.
  - Commit `.ai/dep-report.json` if your repo is stable to speed up local workflows (optional).

## Troubleshooting & Safety

- No features found:
  - Ensure you ran `npm run dep:report` at the right root; check `includeOnly` in `.dependency-cruiser.js` matches your folders.
  - Verify `.ai/extractor-suppress.json` isn‚Äôt hiding everything; start empty and add globs gradually.
- False positives (dynamic imports/feature flags):
  - Annotate hotspots with `@dynamic`/`@keep` in code when applicable; add specific globs to `.ai/extractor-suppress.json`.
- Coverage drops unexpectedly:
  - Confirm generated shards exist: `docs/prd.generated/PRD.generated.md`, `docs/architecture.generated/architecture.generated.md`.
  - Mentions match by literal name; use consistent casing/wording and re-run `reverse:align`.
- Gate fails but docs updated:
  - Check `.ai/reports/docs-code-alignment.json` and `.ai/reports/simple-quality-gate.json` for the missing items list.
- Baseline missing (delta-only):
  - Local runs are advisory if baseline missing; CI computes baseline from the PR base ref before enforcing.
- Data safety:
  - Extractors never render env values; only keys/paths are recorded. Generated shards are replace-only areas; human prose remains untouched.

## Performance Budget

- Targets: ‚â§60s p95 for typical repos; ‚â§120s p99 for large monorepos.
- Mitigations:
  - Use `dep:report` roots to limit scope (per-package for large workspaces).
  - Add precise suppress globs to skip vendor, generated, mocks, and legacy trees.
  - Prefer incremental runs during development (CI already captures baseline + head efficiently).
  - Keep CI Node at v20+ and use `npm ci --prefer-offline` for faster installs.

### Config Matching Rules
- `.ai/extractor-suppress.json`: repo‚Äërelative glob paths; applied pre‚Äëanalysis to reduce false positives (e.g., `"**/generated/**"`, `"**/__mocks__/**"`).
- `.ai/story-ignore.json`: case‚Äëinsensitive match on feature `key` or `name` to suppress StoryCandidates (e.g., `"ci_cd"`, `"metrics"`).
- `.ai/critical-entities.json`: case‚Äëinsensitive match on feature `key` or `name`; require 100% coverage for these in G‚ÄëPRD/G‚ÄëARCH (support coming to gate).

Copy‚Äëpaste examples:
```jsonc
// .ai/extractor-suppress.json
["**/generated/**", "**/__mocks__/**", "**/legacy/**"]

// .ai/story-ignore.json
["ci_cd", "metrics", "some noisy feature name"]

// .ai/critical-entities.json
["security", "api:/v1/users#GET", "payment processing"]
```

### Quality Gate Controls (Details)
- Override threshold: `node tools/workflow-orchestrator.js quality-gate --coverage 0.9`
- Enforce delta-only: `--delta-only` ensures the PR does not increase missing coverage vs base.
- Artifacts for debugging:
  - `.ai/reports/docs-code-alignment.json` (coverage details)
  - `.ai/reports/simple-quality-gate.json` (gate result)
  - `.ai/reports/coverage-baseline.json` (baseline snapshot in CI)

### Using OpenAI Codex CLI

Prefer terminal-based agent control? Use Codex CLI to activate SEMAD agents and run commands locally.

- Install Codex CLI:
  - `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Activate an agent and run a command:
  - `codex "as dev agent, *help"`
- Implement a story (story scanning happens only for story commands):
  - `codex "as dev agent, execute *implement-next-story"`
- Run an ad‚Äëhoc task (no story scanning; loads baseline project files):
  - `codex "as dev agent, execute *adhoc 'Refactor utils naming' --paths src/utils/legacy.ts src/index.ts"`
- Verify results:
  - Check logs in `.ai/history/dev_log.jsonl`
  - Check ad‚Äëhoc reports in `.ai/adhoc/`

Notes
- Always start with a clear activation phrase: ‚Äúas dev agent ‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúactivate dev agent ‚Ä¶‚Äù.
- Use the `*` prefix for agent commands.
- The Dev agent respects `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (e.g., `devStartup: idle`, `devLoadAlwaysFiles`).
- More examples: see `docs/codex-integration.md`.

### Minimal CLI Shim (no Codex)

If you aren‚Äôt using Codex, use the shim to route agent-like commands locally:

- Ad‚Äëhoc tasks: `node tools/agent.js "/dev *adhoc 'Refactor utils' --paths src/utils/legacy.ts src/index.ts"`
  - Writes logs to `.ai/history/dev_log.jsonl` and report to `.ai/adhoc/`.
  - Only `/dev *adhoc` is supported in the shim (by design).

## üåü Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

SEMAD-METHOD's framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Expansion packs can also extend SEMAD-METHOD with domain-specific functionality. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) to learn more.

## Search Tools Generation

SEMAD-METHOD includes automatic search query generation for external documentation retrieval. After PRD creation, the system extracts keywords and generates targeted search queries.

### Running Search Tools Generation

```bash
# Generate search tools from PRD
npm run generate:search-tools

# With custom paths
npm run generate:search-tools -- --prd docs/prd.md --output outputs/search-tools.yaml

# View available options
node scripts/generate-search-tools.js --help
```

### Generated Output

The tool creates a `search-tools.yaml` file containing:
- Extracted domain keywords from your PRD
- Mapped search queries for various documentation sources (GitHub, npm, API docs)
- Repository-specific search configurations

### Using Search Results

Once search tools are generated, agents can use the search queries to find relevant external documentation during development. The generated `search-tools.yaml` file contains pre-configured searches that agents can execute to improve code quality and reduce hallucinations.

üìö **[See the complete Search Tools Guide](docs/search-tools-guide.md)** for detailed information on:
- How agents use search-tools.yaml during development
- What happens with search results after generation
- Supported search providers and how to add new ones
- Advanced usage and customization options

## Available Agents

SEMAD-METHOD includes specialized AI agents for each role:

- **Orchestrator** (`/orchestrator`) - Master coordinator for the entire workflow
- **Analyst** (`/analyst`) - Requirements gathering and analysis
- **PM** (`/pm`) - Product requirements and prioritization
