SEMAD-METHOD is an enhanced fork of the BMad-Method framework that introduces structured engineering practices to multi-agent AI development. This fork focuses on reducing hallucination, improving agent reliability, and ensuring deterministic behavior through YAML/JSON-based task definitions, structured memory systems, and formal contract specifications.

## üöÄ Key Improvements in SEMAD-METHOD

This fork introduces eight major improvements over the original BMad-Method:

### 1. **Structured Tasks & Checklists (YAML/JSON)**
- **What Changed**: Converted all free-form Markdown tasks to structured YAML format with explicit schemas
- **Why**: Eliminates ambiguity and LLM interpretation errors
- **Impact**: Deterministic task execution with validation support
- **Files**: All tasks in `bmad-core/structured-tasks/`, validated by schemas in `bmad-core/schemas/`

### 2. **Working Memory & Scratchboard System**
- **What Changed**: Added persistent working memory for each agent session
- **Why**: Reduces context loss and hallucination between steps
- **Impact**: Agents maintain state across complex multi-step operations
- **Implementation**: Memory files in `.ai/` directory, Qdrant integration for long-term memory
- **Documentation**: See [Memory System Explanation](MEMORY-SYSTEM-EXPLANATION.md) and [Detailed Memory Guide](bmad-core/docs/memory-system-detailed-guide.md)

### 3. **Dynamic Plan Adaptation**
- **What Changed**: Automatic task decomposition for complex operations
- **Why**: Prevents monolithic processing of large instruction sets
- **Impact**: Better handling of complex tasks through divide-and-conquer approach
- **Files**: `bmad-core/tools/dynamic-planner.js`, `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dynamic-plan-rules.yaml`

### 4. **Automated Search Tools Generation**
- **What Changed**: PRD-driven search query generation for documentation retrieval
- **Why**: Improves context by automatically identifying needed external resources
- **Impact**: Agents have access to relevant documentation during development
- **Usage**: `npm run generate:search-tools`

### 5. **StoryContract Specification**
- **What Changed**: Formal contract blocks in story files replacing prose summaries
- **Why**: Eliminates hallucination between PRD and story creation
- **Impact**: Developers work from structured specifications, not interpretations
- **Schema**: `bmad-core/schemas/story-contract-schema.json`

### 6. **Contract-Driven Development**
- **What Changed**: Dev agent uses StoryContract as single source of truth
- **Why**: Prevents implementation drift from requirements
- **Impact**: Direct traceability from requirements to implementation

### 7. **Comprehensive Validation System**
- **What Changed**: JSON Schema validation for all artifacts
- **Why**: Catches errors before they propagate through the workflow
- **Impact**: Build-time validation ensures quality
- **Scripts**: `npm run validate`, `scripts/validate-all.js`

### 8. **Enhanced Testing & Error Handling**
- **What Changed**: Complete test coverage with 284 passing tests
- **Why**: Ensures reliability across all components
- **Impact**: Production-ready system with deterministic behavior
- **Status**: 100% test pass rate achieved

### 9. **Dev‚ÜîQA Iterative Flow Option** *(New)*
- **What Changed**: Added choice between linear Dev‚ÜíQA flow and iterative Dev‚ÜîQA loop
- **Why**: Different projects need different quality assurance approaches
- **Impact**: Teams can choose immediate iteration on QA findings or batch processing
- **Usage**: `npm run orchestrate` or configure in `.bmad-workflow.yaml`

## Overview

**SEMAD-METHOD builds on BMad's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Structured Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. SEMAD enhances this with structured YAML tasks, working memory persistence, and dynamic plan adaptation to ensure consistent, hallucination-free planning.

**2. Contract-Driven Development:** The Scrum Master agent transforms detailed plans into structured StoryContract specifications embedded in development stories. SEMAD's formal contract system ensures Dev agents work from explicit specifications, not interpretations, eliminating implementation drift.

**3. Validated Engineering Workflow:** Every artifact - from tasks to stories to implementations - is validated against formal schemas. Combined with comprehensive testing (284 tests, 100% passing), SEMAD ensures production-ready reliability.

This enhanced approach eliminates **planning inconsistency**, **context loss**, and **hallucination** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with a formal contract specification and complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the SEMAD Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how SEMAD-METHOD works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents with structured validation
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through StoryContract specifications

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **These diagrams explain 90% of SEMAD Method workflow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation, StoryContract generation, and the SM/Dev/QA workflow with formal contracts is essential - and also explains why this provides deterministic, hallucination-free development!

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to BMad Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#bmad-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! See the [User guide](bmad-core/user-guide.md) for more details

### Alternative: Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
npm run install:bmad # build and install all to a destination folder
```

## üåü Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

BMad's natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core BMad-Method with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) and learn to create your own!

## Search Tools Generation

BMad now includes automatic search query generation for external documentation retrieval. After PRD creation, the system extracts keywords and generates targeted search queries.

### Running Search Tools Generation

```bash
# Generate search tools from PRD
npm run generate:search-tools

# With custom paths
npm run generate:search-tools -- --prd docs/prd.md --output outputs/search-tools.yaml

# View available options
node scripts/generate-search-tools.js --help
```

### Generated Output

The tool creates a `search-tools.yaml` file containing:
- Extracted domain keywords from your PRD
- Mapped search queries for various documentation sources (GitHub, npm, API docs)
- Repository-specific search configurations

### Ingesting into Qdrant

Once search tools are generated, you can ingest the results into Qdrant for retrieval-augmented development:

```bash
# Coming soon: Qdrant ingestion script
# npm run ingest:search-results -- --input outputs/search-tools.yaml
```

This enables AI agents to access relevant external documentation during development, improving code quality and reducing hallucinations.

üìö **[See the complete Search Tools Guide](docs/search-tools-guide.md)** for detailed information on:
- How agents use search-tools.yaml during development
- What happens with search results after generation
- Supported search providers and how to add new ones
- Advanced usage and customization options

## Backward Compatibility

SEMAD-METHOD maintains full backward compatibility with BMad-Method:
- All original agents and workflows continue to function
- Markdown tasks are still supported alongside YAML versions
- Existing BMad projects can be upgraded seamlessly
- New features are opt-in through configuration flags
