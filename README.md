SEMAD-METHOD is an enhanced fork of the BMad-Method framework that introduces structured engineering practices to multi-agent AI development. This fork focuses on reducing hallucination, improving agent reliability, and ensuring deterministic behavior through YAML/JSON-based task definitions, structured memory systems, and formal contract specifications.

## üöÄ Key Improvements in SEMAD-METHOD

This fork introduces eight major improvements over the original BMad-Method:

### 1. **Structured Tasks & Checklists (YAML/JSON)**
- **What Changed**: Converted all free-form Markdown tasks to structured YAML format with explicit schemas
- **Why**: Eliminates ambiguity and LLM interpretation errors
- **Impact**: Deterministic task execution with validation support
- **Files**: All tasks in `bmad-core/structured-tasks/`, validated by schemas in `bmad-core/schemas/`

### 2. **Simple Task Tracking System**
- **What Changed**: Added lightweight task tracking for agent workflows
- **Why**: Ensures systematic completion of all tasks without missing items
- **Impact**: Agents can track progress through complex multi-step operations
- **Implementation**: In-memory tracking with `.ai/` directory for persistence, simple file-based logging
- **Key Files**: `simple-task-tracker.js` for workflow tracking, `track-progress.js` for persistent observations

### 3. **Dynamic Plan Adaptation**
- **What Changed**: Automatic task decomposition for complex operations
- **Why**: Prevents monolithic processing of large instruction sets
- **Impact**: Better handling of complex tasks through divide-and-conquer approach
- **Files**: `bmad-core/tools/dynamic-planner.js`, `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dynamic-plan-rules.yaml`

### 4. **Automated Search Tools Generation**
- **What Changed**: PRD-driven search query generation for documentation retrieval
- **Why**: Improves context by automatically identifying needed external resources
- **Impact**: Agents have access to relevant documentation during development
- **Usage**: `npm run generate:search-tools`

### 5. **StoryContract Specification**
- **What Changed**: Formal contract blocks in story files replacing prose summaries
- **Why**: Eliminates hallucination between PRD and story creation
- **Impact**: Developers work from structured specifications, not interpretations
- **Schema**: `bmad-core/schemas/story-contract-schema.json`

### 6. **Contract-Driven Development**
- **What Changed**: Dev agent uses StoryContract as single source of truth
- **Why**: Prevents implementation drift from requirements
- **Impact**: Direct traceability from requirements to implementation

### 7. **Comprehensive Validation System**
- **What Changed**: JSON Schema validation for all artifacts
- **Why**: Catches errors before they propagate through the workflow
- **Impact**: Build-time validation ensures quality
- **Scripts**: `npm run validate`, `scripts/validate-all.js`

### 8. **Enhanced Testing & Error Handling**
- **What Changed**: Complete test coverage with 284 passing tests
- **Why**: Ensures reliability across all components
- **Impact**: Production-ready system with deterministic behavior
- **Status**: 100% test pass rate achieved

### 9. **Dev‚ÜîQA Iterative Flow Option** *(New)*
- **What Changed**: Added choice between linear Dev‚ÜíQA flow and iterative Dev‚ÜîQA loop
- **Why**: Different projects need different quality assurance approaches
- **Impact**: Teams can choose immediate iteration on QA findings or batch processing
- **Usage**: `npm run orchestrate` or configure in `.bmad-workflow.yaml`

## üìä Results

These improvements have transformed BMad-Method into a production-ready system:
- **Test Coverage**: 284 tests, 100% passing
- **Agent Reliability**: 16/16 agent connectivity tests passing
- **Dependency Management**: All 135 dependencies validated and working
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Structured contracts eliminate interpretation errors
- **Task Tracking**: Simple, reliable progress tracking ensures nothing gets missed

## Overview

**SEMAD-METHOD builds on BMad's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Structured Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. SEMAD enhances this with structured YAML tasks, simple task tracking, and dynamic plan adaptation to ensure consistent, hallucination-free planning.

**2. Contract-Driven Development:** The Scrum Master agent transforms detailed plans into structured StoryContract specifications embedded in development stories. SEMAD's formal contract system ensures Dev agents work from explicit specifications, not interpretations, eliminating implementation drift.

**3. Validated Engineering Workflow:** Every artifact - from tasks to stories to implementations - is validated against formal schemas. Combined with comprehensive testing (284 tests, 100% passing), SEMAD ensures production-ready reliability.

This enhanced approach eliminates **planning inconsistency**, **context loss**, and **hallucination** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with a formal contract specification and complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the SEMAD Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how SEMAD-METHOD works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents with structured validation
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through StoryContract specifications

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **These diagrams explain 90% of SEMAD Method workflow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation, StoryContract generation, and the SM/Dev/QA workflow with formal contracts is essential - and also explains why this provides deterministic, hallucination-free development!

## üåü Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

SEMAD-METHOD's framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Expansion packs can also extend SEMAD-METHOD with domain-specific functionality. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) to learn more.

## Search Tools Generation

SEMAD-METHOD includes automatic search query generation for external documentation retrieval. After PRD creation, the system extracts keywords and generates targeted search queries.

### Running Search Tools Generation

```bash
# Generate search tools from PRD
npm run generate:search-tools

# With custom paths
npm run generate:search-tools -- --prd docs/prd.md --output outputs/search-tools.yaml

# View available options
node scripts/generate-search-tools.js --help
```

### Generated Output

The tool creates a `search-tools.yaml` file containing:
- Extracted domain keywords from your PRD
- Mapped search queries for various documentation sources (GitHub, npm, API docs)
- Repository-specific search configurations

### Using Search Results

Once search tools are generated, agents can use the search queries to find relevant external documentation during development. The generated `search-tools.yaml` file contains pre-configured searches that agents can execute to improve code quality and reduce hallucinations.

üìö **[See the complete Search Tools Guide](docs/search-tools-guide.md)** for detailed information on:
- How agents use search-tools.yaml during development
- What happens with search results after generation
- Supported search providers and how to add new ones
- Advanced usage and customization options

## Available Agents

SEMAD-METHOD includes specialized AI agents for each role:

- **Orchestrator** (`/orchestrator`) - Master coordinator for the entire workflow
- **Analyst** (`/analyst`) - Requirements gathering and analysis
- **PM** (`/pm`) - Product requirements and prioritization
- **Architect** (`/architect`) - Technical design and system architecture

```yaml
structuredTasks: true          # Use YAML task definitions
useStoryContracts: true       # Use formal story contracts
dynamicPlanAdaptation: true   # Enable automatic task decomposition
simpleTaskTracking: true      # Use simple task tracking system
```
