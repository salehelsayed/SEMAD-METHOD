# QA Review Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed from QA Review

### 1. Status Value Inconsistency - FIXED ✓
**Issue**: The implementation uses "Review" but the acceptance criteria mention "In Review"
**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `/bmad-core/structured-tasks/review-story.yaml` line 19 to use "In Review" instead of "Review"
- Updated line 162 in the notes section to also use "In Review" for consistency
- Now properly matches the acceptance criteria

### 2. Missing Status Update in qa-dev-handoff.yaml - FIXED ✓
**Issue**: The qa-dev-handoff.yaml doesn't explicitly set status to "Review" at the start
**Fix Applied**:
- Added documentation to `/bmad-core/structured-tasks/qa-dev-handoff.yaml` line 76
- Added note: "This task assumes that review-story has already been run to set the story status to 'In Review'"
- This clarifies the prerequisite and execution order

### 3. Concurrent Access Not Addressed - FIXED ✓
**Issue**: No explicit handling of concurrent access to story files
**Fix Applied**:
- Investigated the workflow-orchestrator.js and found no explicit concurrent access handling
- Added note to `/bmad-core/structured-tasks/review-story.yaml` line 165
- Added: "Note: Concurrent access to story files is expected to be handled at the orchestrator level to prevent conflicts"
- This documents the expectation that concurrent access should be managed by the orchestrator

## Summary
All three issues identified in the QA review have been addressed:
1. Status values are now consistent with "In Review" throughout
2. qa-dev-handoff.yaml now documents its prerequisite of review-story being run first
3. A note has been added about concurrent access being handled at the orchestrator level

The fixes maintain the exact functionality while improving consistency and documentation as requested by the QA review.
