# Integration Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes Based on Audit Report

### 1. ✅ Updated Function Registry
**File:** `/tools/lib/function-registry.js`

**Changes:**
- Removed all imports for Qdrant and memory-related modules
- Removed memory logging functions (logTaskMemory, logWorkingMemory, logLongTermMemory)
- Removed working memory functions (updateWorkingMemory, updateWorkingMemoryAndExit)
- Removed long-term memory functions (saveToLongTermMemory, saveToLongTermMemoryAndExit)
- Kept only simple memory and task tracker functions
- Updated parameter mappings to reflect only the remaining functions

### 2. ✅ Cleaned Up Memory-Related Tasks
**Deleted Files:**
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dev-save-memory.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/qa-save-memory.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/load-memory-action.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/manage-memory.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/memory-task-template.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/persist-memory.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/retrieve-context.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/save-and-clean-memory-action.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/update-working-memory.yaml`
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/validate-memory-operations.yaml`

### 3. ✅ Cleaned Up Utils Directory
**Deleted Memory-Related Utilities:**
- `agent-memory-loader.js`
- `agent-memory-manager.js`
- `agent-memory-persistence.js`
- `memory-usage-logger.js`
- `qdrant.js`
- `persist-memory-cli.js`
- `prepare-memory-data.js`
- `memory-compatibility-wrapper.js`
- `qa-memory-wrapper.js`
- `dev-save-memory-wrapper.js`
- `memory-audit-cli.js`
- `memory-config.js`
- `memory-error-handler.js`
- `memory-health-config.js`
- `memory-health.js`
- `memory-hygiene.js`
- `memory-lifecycle.js`
- `memory-operation-validator.js`
- `memory-summarizer.js`
- `memory-transaction.js`
- `memory-validation-wrapper.js`
- `qdrant-collection-resolver.js`
- `qdrant-docs-search.js`
- `unified-memory-manager.js`
- `update-working-memory.yaml` (misplaced YAML in utils)
- `retrieve-context.yaml` (misplaced YAML in utils)
- `validate-next-story.yaml` (misplaced YAML in utils)

### 4. ✅ Verified dev-track-progress Task
**File:** `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dev-track-progress.yaml`
- Already properly configured to use simple tracking functions
- Uses `trackProgress` and `saveDebugLog` functions
- No memory references found

### 5. ✅ Rebuilt Agent Bundles
- Ran `npm run build:agents` to regenerate all dist files
- Build completed successfully
- Expected warnings about missing memory tasks appeared (these tasks were intentionally deleted)

## Remaining Simple Tracking System

The following files remain and constitute the simplified tracking system:
- `bmad-core/utils/simple-task-tracker.js` - Core task tracking functionality
- `bmad-core/utils/simpleMemory.js` - Simple memory interface
- `bmad-core/utils/track-progress.js` - Progress tracking utilities
- `bmad-core/structured-tasks/dev-track-progress.yaml` - Task tracking structured task

## Result

All Qdrant and complex memory system references have been completely removed from the codebase. The agents now use only the simple in-memory task tracking system, which is much more maintainable and doesn't require external dependencies.
