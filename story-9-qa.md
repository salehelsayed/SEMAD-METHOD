# QA Review Report: Story 9 - YAML Template Migration

**Review Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Reviewed By**: QA Agent  
**Story**: Migrate from markdown story template (.md) to YAML story template (.yaml)

## Executive Summary

The implementation successfully migrated the core story template system from markdown to YAML format. All acceptance criteria have been met, with the YAML template (`story-tmpl.yaml`) now serving as the single source of truth for story structure across the BMad system.

## Review Scope

### Story Requirements
- **User Story**: As a Product Owner, I want the story creation process to reference the YAML template (story-tmpl.yaml) instead of the deprecated markdown template
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. All tasks and agents should load bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml instead of .md
  2. The YAML template remains the single source of truth for story structure
  3. The system stops referencing or searching for .md templates

### Implementation Claims
1. Updated validate-next-story.yaml to reference story-tmpl.yaml
2. Fixed YAML syntax errors in dev.md and qa.md
3. Verified story-tmpl.yaml exists and story-tmpl.md doesn't exist
4. Rebuilt distribution files

## Detailed Findings

### Template Compliance Issues
✅ **No Issues Found**
- story-tmpl.yaml exists and is properly formatted
- story-tmpl.md has been removed from the system
- Template structure follows YAML best practices

### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)
✅ **No Critical Issues Found**

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)
✅ **No Issues Found**

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)
None identified

### Anti-Hallucination Findings
✅ **All Claims Verified**
- validate-next-story.yaml correctly references story-tmpl.yaml (line 37)
- All core agents correctly reference story-tmpl.yaml in their dependencies
- Distribution files were rebuilt and contain correct references
- No references to story-tmpl.md found in the core system

## Verification Details

### 1. Template File Status
- ✅ `/Users/I560101/Project-Sat/SEMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` exists and is well-formed
- ✅ `/Users/I560101/Project-Sat/SEMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` does not exist

### 2. Agent Dependencies Verification
All core agents correctly reference story-tmpl.yaml:
- ✅ `sm.md` - line 67: `- story-tmpl.yaml`
- ✅ `bmad-master.md` - line 93: `- story-tmpl.yaml`
- ✅ `qa.md` - line 89: `- story-tmpl.yaml`
- ✅ `po.md` - line 76: `- story-tmpl.yaml`
- ✅ `dev.md` - No template dependencies (correct, as dev agent doesn't create stories)

### 3. Task File Verification
- ✅ `validate-next-story.yaml` - line 37: correctly references `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`
- ✅ No other task files reference story templates

### 4. Distribution Files
- ✅ Distribution files rebuilt on Jul 31 01:21
- ✅ Distribution files contain correct YAML template references
- ✅ Example from `dist/agents/sm.txt`:
  - Line 88: `- story-tmpl.yaml`
  - Line 497: Full template content included

### 5. System-Wide Search Results
- ✅ No references to `story-tmpl.md` found in core system
- ✅ 24 files correctly reference `story-tmpl.yaml`
- ℹ️ Note: Some expansion packs reference `game-story-tmpl.md` but these are domain-specific templates, not the core story template

## Code Quality Analysis

### Readability and Maintainability
- **Rating**: ✅ Excellent
- YAML template is well-structured with clear sections and documentation
- Template versioning implemented (version 2.0)
- Clear ownership model with owner/editors defined per section

### Proper Error Handling
- **Rating**: ✅ Good
- validate-next-story.yaml includes template loading validation
- Clear error messages if template is missing

### Best Practices Compliance
- **Rating**: ✅ Excellent
- Follows YAML best practices
- Consistent indentation and structure
- Proper use of YAML features (anchors, lists, maps)

## Security Review
✅ **No Security Issues Found**
- Template contains no executable code
- No sensitive data exposure
- Proper access control through owner/editor definitions

## Performance Assessment
✅ **No Performance Concerns**
- YAML parsing is efficient
- Template loaded once per story creation
- No performance regression from markdown to YAML

## Testing Coverage
⚠️ **Testing Not Assessed**
- No unit tests were mentioned in the implementation
- Recommend adding tests to verify template loading behavior

## Overall Assessment

**Verdict**: ✅ **APPROVED**

The implementation successfully achieves all acceptance criteria. The migration from markdown to YAML story templates has been completed correctly, with all references updated throughout the system. The YAML template is now the single source of truth for story structure.

### Strengths
1. Complete and thorough migration with no markdown references remaining
2. All agent dependencies correctly updated
3. Distribution files properly rebuilt
4. YAML template is well-structured and maintainable
5. Implementation matches the stated changes exactly

### Recommendations
