# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Execute Checklist

## Purpose

Generic task for executing any checklist file systematically. Supports both interactive  (section-by-section) and comprehensive (all-at-once) execution modes. Tracks progress,  captures findings, and provides structured results.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Initialize Working Memory

Initialize working memory for checklist execution session

- Execute task `update-working-memory` with agentName and taskId='execute-checklist'
- Verify checklist file exists at specified path
- Load checklist content and parse structure

### 2. Determine Execution Mode

Determine how to execute the checklist based on user preference

- Check if execution mode was provided in input
- If mode not specified, ask user for preference:
- **How would you like to work through this checklist?**
- 1. Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- 2. All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Select option (1 or 2):

### 3. Parse Checklist Structure

Analyze the checklist to identify sections and items

- Identify main sections in the checklist
- Extract checklist items (lines starting with '- [ ]')
- Parse any LLM instructions embedded in [[LLM: ]] blocks
- Create structured representation of checklist hierarchy
- Record total items count and section breakdown in memory

### 4. Execute Checklist Items

Work through each checklist item based on selected mode

- For each section in the checklist:
- Read and understand the section context and any LLM instructions
- Evaluate each checklist item in the section
- Mark items as checked [x] or unchecked [ ] based on evaluation
- Document findings, issues, or observations for each item
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** If interactive mode: Present section findings and await confirmation
- Update progress tracking in working memory

### 5. Generate Summary Report

Create comprehensive report of checklist execution results

- Calculate overall completion percentage
- Summarize findings by category/section
- Identify critical issues or blockers
- Generate recommendations based on unchecked items
- If checklist includes specific report format (e.g., validation tables), use that format
- Store execution results in working memory for future reference

### 6. Present Results and Next Steps

Present the final results and offer follow-up actions

- Display the summary report to the user
- Highlight any critical issues or blockers found
- Show completion statistics (X of Y items passed)
- If unchecked items exist, offer to:
- 1. Get detailed analysis of failed items
- 2. Generate action plan to address issues
- 3. Re-run specific sections
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Would you like to perform any follow-up actions?

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.
**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"
CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:
CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]


## Important Notes

### 1. Initialize Memory Context

Setup working memory and retrieve relevant context

- Initialize working memory for sharding task
- Record document being sharded in memory for future reference

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:
1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
2. **Adjust heading levels**:
   ```txt
     - ### ‚Üí ##
     - #### ‚Üí ###
     - ##### ‚Üí ####
     - etc.
   ```
3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

- Remove special characters
- Replace spaces with dashes
- Example: "## Tech Stack" ‚Üí `tech-stack.md`
- The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
- All subsection levels decrease by 1:

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:
1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:
```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:
   ```language
   content
   ```
2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```
3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting
4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting
5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks
6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact
7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:
1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 6. Update Memory with Results

Record sharding results in memory

- Update working memory with sharded document structure
- Store document relationships for future reference

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:
```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)
==================== END: .bmad-core/structured-tasks/shard-doc.yaml ====================

==================== START: .bmad-core/structured-tasks/correct-course.yaml ====================
# Correct Course Task

## Purpose

- Guide a structured response to a change trigger using the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
- Analyze the impacts of the change on epics, project artifacts, and the MVP, guided by the checklist's structure.
- Explore potential solutions (e.g., adjust scope, rollback elements, re-scope features) as prompted by the checklist.
- Draft specific, actionable proposed updates to any affected project artifacts (e.g., epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document sections) based on the analysis.
- Produce a consolidated "Sprint Change Proposal" document that contains the impact analysis and the clearly drafted proposed edits for user review and approval.
- Ensure a clear handoff path if the nature of the changes necessitates fundamental replanning by other core agents (like PM or Architect).

## Task Execution

### 1. Initialize Memory Context

Retrieve relevant context from previous sessions

- Call retrieve-context task to get relevant past decisions and changes
- Update working memory with current change context

### 1. Initial Setup & Mode Selection

- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** **Acknowledge Task & Inputs:**
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Confirm with the user that the "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated.
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Verify the change trigger and ensure you have the user's initial explanation of the issue and its perceived impact.
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts (e.g., PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture Documents, UI/UX Specifications) and, critically, the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Ask the user their preferred interaction mode for this task:
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** **"Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** Shall we work through the change-checklist section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each relevant part before moving to the next? This allows for detailed, step-by-step refinement."
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** **"YOLO Mode (Batch Processing):** Or, would you prefer I conduct a more batched analysis based on the checklist and then present a consolidated set of findings and proposed changes for a broader review? This can be quicker for initial assessment but might require more extensive review of the combined proposals."
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Once the user chooses, confirm the selected mode and then inform the user: "We will now use the change-checklist to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."

### 2. Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched, per Interaction Mode)

- Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of the change-checklist (typically covering Change Context, Epic/Story Impact Analysis, Artifact Conflict Resolution, and Path Evaluation/Recommendation).
- For each checklist item or logical group of items (depending on interaction mode):
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Present the relevant prompt(s) or considerations from the checklist to the user.
- Request necessary information and actively analyze the relevant project artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture documents, story history, etc.) to assess the impact.
- Discuss your findings for each item with the user.
- Record the status of each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`) and any pertinent notes or decisions.
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** Collaboratively agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by Section 4 of the checklist.

### 3. Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)

- Based on the completed checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and the agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans that would necessitate immediate handoff to PM/Architect):
- Identify the specific project artifacts that require updates (e.g., specific epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document components, diagrams).
- **Draft the proposed changes directly and explicitly for each identified artifact.** Examples include:
- Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority.
- Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics.
- Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (e.g., providing an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear textual description of the change to an existing diagram).
- Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific sections within the PRD or architecture documents.
- Drafting new, small supporting artifacts if necessary (e.g., a brief addendum for a specific decision).
- If in "Incremental Mode," discuss and refine these proposed edits for each artifact or small group of related artifacts with the user as they are drafted.
- If in "YOLO Mode," compile all drafted edits for presentation in the next step.

### 4. Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits

- Synthesize the complete change-checklist analysis (covering findings from Sections 1-4) and all the agreed-upon proposed edits (from Instruction 3) into a single document titled "Sprint Change Proposal." This proposal should align with the structure suggested by Section 5 of the change-checklist.
- The proposal must clearly present:
- **Analysis Summary:** A concise overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope), and the rationale for the chosen path forward.
- **Specific Proposed Edits:** For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]", "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
- Present the complete draft of the "Sprint Change Proposal" to the user for final review and feedback. Incorporate any final adjustments requested by the user.

### 5. Finalize & Determine Next Steps

- Obtain explicit user approval for the "Sprint Change Proposal," including all the specific edits documented within it.
- Provide the finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to the user.
- Update working memory with final change decisions and outcomes
- **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
- **[USER INPUT REQUIRED]** **If the approved edits sufficiently address the change and can be implemented directly or organized by a PO/SM:** State that the "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal, and the user can now proceed with implementing or logging these changes (e.g., updating actual project documents, backlog items). Suggest handoff to a PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate.
- **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.
- **Primary:** A "Sprint Change Proposal" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
- A summary of the change-checklist analysis (issue, impact, rationale for the chosen path).
- Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected project artifacts.
- **Implicit:** An annotated change-checklist (or the record of its completion) reflecting the discussions, findings, and decisions made during the process.

- **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.

# Change Navigation Checklist

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by fully understanding what went wrong and why. Don't jump to solutions yet. Ask probing questions:

- What exactly happened that triggered this review?
- Is this a one-time issue or symptomatic of a larger problem?
- Could this have been anticipated earlier?
- What assumptions were incorrect?

Be specific and factual, not blame-oriented.
Changes ripple through the project structure. Systematically evaluate:

1. Can we salvage the current epic with modifications?
2. Do future epics still make sense given this change?
3. Are we creating or eliminating dependencies?
4. Does the epic sequence need reordering?

Think about both immediate and downstream effects.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
- [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
- [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
- [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
- [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
- [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Documentation drives development in BMad. Check each artifact:

1. Does this change invalidate documented decisions?
2. Are architectural assumptions still valid?
3. Do user flows need rethinking?
4. Are technical constraints different than documented?

Be thorough - missed conflicts cause future problems.]]

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
- [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
- [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
- [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
- [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
- [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
- [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
- [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
- [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
- [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
- [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 3. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present options clearly with pros/cons. For each path:

1. What's the effort required?
2. What work gets thrown away?
3. What risks are we taking?
4. How does this affect timeline?
5. Is this sustainable long-term?

Be honest about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
- [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
- [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
- [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
- [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
- [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
- [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
- [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
- [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
- [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
- [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
- [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
- [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
- [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 4. Sprint Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must be actionable and clear. Ensure:

1. The issue is explained in plain language
2. Impacts are quantified where possible
3. The recommended path has clear rationale
4. Next steps are specific and assigned
5. Success criteria for the change are defined

This proposal guides all subsequent work.]]

- [ ] **Identified Issue Summary:** Clear, concise problem statement.
- [ ] **Epic Impact Summary:** How epics are affected.
- [ ] **Artifact Adjustment Needs:** List of documents to change.
- [ ] **Recommended Path Forward:** Chosen solution with rationale.
- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 5. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Changes require coordination. Before concluding:

1. Is the user fully aligned with the plan?
2. Do all stakeholders understand the impacts?
3. Are handoffs to other agents clear?
4. Is there a rollback plan if the change fails?
5. How will we validate the change worked?

Get explicit approval - implicit agreement causes problems.

FINAL REPORT:
After completing the checklist, provide a concise summary:

- What changed and why
- What we're doing about it
- Who needs to do what
- When we'll know if it worked

Keep it action-oriented and forward-looking.]]

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.

## Validation Result

  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.
