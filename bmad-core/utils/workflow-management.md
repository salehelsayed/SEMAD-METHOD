# Workflow Management Utility

## Overview
Utility for managing and coordinating multi-agent workflows in the BMad-Method system.

## Core Functions

### Workflow State Management
- Track workflow execution state
- Manage workflow context across agents
- Handle workflow transitions and handoffs
- Maintain workflow history and audit trail

### Agent Coordination
- Facilitate agent-to-agent communication
- Manage agent activation and deactivation
- Handle context passing between agents
- Coordinate resource allocation

### Workflow Execution
- Execute workflow steps in sequence
- Handle conditional branching
- Manage parallel workflow execution
- Handle error recovery and rollback

### Context Management
- Maintain global workflow context
- Merge agent-specific contexts
- Handle context transformations
- Persist context across sessions

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Workflow Execution
```yaml
workflow:
  name: project-development
  steps:
    - agent: analyst
      task: create-prd
    - agent: architect
      task: create-architecture
    - agent: sm
      task: create-stories
```

### Context Handoff
```yaml
handoff:
  from: analyst
  to: architect
  context:
    - prd_document
    - requirements
    - constraints
```

### Parallel Execution
```yaml
parallel:
  agents:
    - id: ux-expert
      task: create-mockups
    - id: architect
      task: design-api
  merge_strategy: combine
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Context Definition**: Always define clear context boundaries
2. **Error Handling**: Include rollback strategies for failed steps
3. **State Persistence**: Save workflow state at key checkpoints
4. **Agent Independence**: Design workflows to minimize agent coupling
5. **Monitoring**: Track workflow progress and performance metrics

## Error Recovery

### Checkpoint Strategy
- Save state before critical operations
- Enable workflow resumption from last checkpoint
- Maintain recovery metadata

### Rollback Procedures
- Define compensating actions
- Handle partial completion scenarios
- Maintain data consistency

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
- Pool agent instances when possible
- Cache frequently used contexts
- Optimize context serialization

### Execution Strategies
- Use async execution where applicable
- Batch similar operations
- Minimize context switching overhead
