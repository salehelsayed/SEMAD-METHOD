## Core Configuration (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMad to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yaml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMad agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration

- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration

- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files

- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMad to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```
