## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMad-Method assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMad agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMad-Method is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMad - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:

- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:

- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:

- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:

- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:

- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:

- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:

- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM → Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:

1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions
