      INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION


      This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.


      IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to
      identify issues now than have them found in review.


      EXECUTION APPROACH:


      1. Go through each section systematically

      2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable

      3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items

      4. Be specific about what was actually implemented

      5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created


      The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.

      Be specific - list each requirement and whether it's complete
      Code quality matters for maintainability. Check each item carefully
      Testing proves your code works. Be honest about test coverage
      Did you actually run and test your code? Be specific about what you tested
      Documentation helps the next developer. What should they know?
      Build issues block everyone. Ensure everything compiles and runs cleanly
      Good documentation prevents future confusion. What needs explaining?

      FINAL DOD SUMMARY

      After completing the checklist:

      1. Summarize what was accomplished in this story
      2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
      3. Identify any technical debt or follow-up work needed
      4. Note any challenges or learnings for future stories
      5. Confirm whether the story is truly ready for review

      Be honest - it's better to flag issues now than have them discovered later.
