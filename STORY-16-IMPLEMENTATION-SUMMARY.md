### 5. Configuration-Driven ✅
- Comprehensive memory settings in `core-config.yaml`
- Environment variable overrides
- Runtime configuration loading

## Memory Configuration Added

  enabled: true
  baseDirectory: ".ai"
  retentionPolicies:
    workingMemory:
      maxAgeDays: 7
      maxObservations: 100

## NPM Scripts Added

```bash
npm run memory:update-tasks      # Update structured tasks with memory actions
npm run memory:test              # Run memory management unit tests  
npm run memory:test:integration  # Run integration tests
```

## Usage Examples

### For Structured Tasks (Automatic)
All structured tasks now automatically include:
- Memory loading at task start
- Memory saving and cleanup at task end
- Context enrichment with relevant memories

### For Agent Runners (Programmatic)
```javascript
const AgentRunner = require('./bmad-core/utils/agent-runner');
const runner = new AgentRunner({ memoryEnabled: true });

const result = await runner.executeWithMemory(
  'dev', 'implement-feature', 
  { storyId: 'story-123' },
  async (context) => {
    // Access memory context
    const previousWork = context.memory.shortTerm?.observations || [];
    return { success: true, observation: 'Feature completed' };
  }
);
```

### Direct Memory Operations
```javascript
const { loadMemoryForTask, saveAndCleanMemory } = require('./bmad-core/utils/unified-memory-manager');

// Load memory with context
const memory = await loadMemoryForTask('sm', { 
  taskId: 'create-story', 
  storyId: 'story-123' 
});

// Save task results  
await saveAndCleanMemory('sm', {
  observation: 'Story created successfully',
  significantFinding: 'Identified new authentication requirements',
  taskCompleted: true
});
```
