# BMad Method Metrics Report

**Generated:** {{GENERATED_AT}}  
**Period:** {{PERIOD}}

## Executive Summary

This report provides key performance indicators (KPIs) for the BMad Method validation system, tracking quality metrics, process efficiency, and system health.

## Key Performance Indicators

### üéØ Contract Pass Rate
- **Current Rate:** {{CONTRACT_PASS_RATE}}%
- **Target:** ‚â•95%
- **Status:** {{CONTRACT_STATUS}}

The contract pass rate measures how often story contracts are successfully fulfilled without validation errors.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time to Green
- **Average:** {{AVG_TIME_TO_GREEN}}
- **Target:** <5 minutes
- **Status:** {{TIME_TO_GREEN_STATUS}}

Time to green tracks how long it takes for changes to pass all validation checks and reach a deployable state.

### üîç Reference Check Failure Rate
- **Current Rate:** {{REFERENCE_FAILURE_RATE}}%
- **Target:** <5%
- **Status:** {{REFERENCE_CHECK_STATUS}}

Reference check failure rate indicates how often code references to files or symbols cannot be resolved.

### üö® System Health Indicators

#### Drift Alarms (Last 24h)
- **Count:** {{DRIFT_ALARMS_24H}}
- **Target:** 0
- **Status:** {{DRIFT_STATUS}}

Drift alarms indicate when the system state diverges from expected configurations.

#### Rollbacks (Last 7 days)
- **Count:** {{ROLLBACKS_7D}}
- **Target:** ‚â§1
- **Status:** {{ROLLBACK_STATUS}}

Rollback count tracks how often changes need to be reverted due to issues.

## Gate Performance Metrics

Gate performance measures how often each validation gate passes on first attempt.

{{GATE_METRICS_TABLE}}

### Gate Performance Analysis
- **Planning Gate:** Validates architectural documents and PRDs before development
- **Dev Gate:** Ensures code changes meet quality standards before QA
- **QA Gate:** Verifies acceptance criteria are met before story completion

## Preflight Check Performance

Preflight checks run before code changes are accepted into the system.

{{PREFLIGHT_METRICS_TABLE}}

### Preflight Check Analysis
- **Schema Check:** Validates artifacts against JSON schemas
- **Contract Check:** Ensures story contracts are present and valid
- **Grounding Check:** Verifies all referenced files/symbols exist
- **Lint Check:** Runs project linters for code quality
- **Type Check:** Runs TypeScript type checking
- **Build Check:** Ensures the project builds successfully

## Trends and Analysis

### Quality Trends
- Contract pass rates have {{CONTRACT_TREND}} over the reporting period
- Reference check reliability is {{REFERENCE_TREND}}
- Gate performance shows {{GATE_TREND}} pattern

### Performance Trends
- Time to green is {{PERFORMANCE_TREND}}
- Build performance is {{BUILD_TREND}}
- Overall system stability is {{STABILITY_TREND}}

## KPI Definitions and Targets

### Contract Pass Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of story contracts that complete successfully without validation errors.  
**Calculation:** (Successful Completions / Total Attempts) √ó 100  
**Target:** ‚â•95%  
**Critical Threshold:** <85%

### Time to Green
**Definition:** Average time from code submission to successful validation completion.  
**Calculation:** Mean of all validation completion times  
**Target:** <5 minutes  
**Critical Threshold:** >15 minutes

### Diff Churn
**Definition:** Average number of lines changed per story implementation.  
**Calculation:** Total lines added/modified/deleted per story  
**Target:** <500 lines per story  
**Critical Threshold:** >1000 lines per story

### Reference Check Failure Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of reference checks that fail due to unresolved symbols or files.  
**Calculation:** (Failed Reference Checks / Total Reference Checks) √ó 100  
**Target:** <5%  
**Critical Threshold:** >15%

### Drift Alarms
**Definition:** Count of system configuration drift alerts in the specified period.  
**Calculation:** Count of drift detection events  
**Target:** 0 per day  
**Critical Threshold:** >3 per day

### Rollback Count
**Definition:** Number of deployments or changes that were reverted due to issues.  
**Calculation:** Count of rollback operations  
**Target:** ‚â§1 per week  
**Critical Threshold:** >3 per week

## Data Sources

This report aggregates data from:
- `.ai/test-logs/*` - Task execution and workflow logs
- Preflight check outputs - Schema, contract, and grounding validation results
- Gate enforcement logs - Planning, dev, and QA gate results
- Reference checker outputs - Symbol and file resolution results
- Rollback manager logs - System rollback events
- Drift detector alerts - Configuration drift notifications

## Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC
- Rates are calculated as percentages rounded to 2 decimal places
- Time durations are displayed in the most appropriate unit (ms, s, m, h)
- Trends require at least 7 days of historical data for meaningful analysis
- This report reflects the state of the system at generation time
