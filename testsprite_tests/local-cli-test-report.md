**Overall Success Rate:** 31.0%

## Key Findings

### 1. Successful Components ✅

The following core components are working correctly:

1. **Structured Task and Checklist Validation** (TC001, TC002)
   - All 34 structured task YAML files validated successfully
   - All 6 checklist YAML files passed schema validation

2. **Working Memory System** (TC003)
   - Memory initialization creates proper JSON files in `.ai/` directory

3. **Build Systems** (TC012)
   - Agent building and dependency resolution working perfectly
   - Team building processes functioning correctly
   - All 10 agents and 4 teams built successfully

4. **Validation Frameworks** (TC006, TC007, TC015)
   - Search tools validation framework operational
   - Story contract validation system working
   - Comprehensive schema validation suite functional

### 2. Failed Components ❌

The following areas need attention:

1. **Missing npm Scripts** (12 failures)
   - Many npm scripts referenced in the test plan are not defined in package.json
   - Missing scripts include: `check:elicitation`, `scan:tasks`, `validate:config`, `dev:next-story`, `qa:review`, `generate:story`, `orchestrate:greenfield`, `orchestrate:path-resolve`, `test:memory-persistence`, `interact:analysis`

2. **Command Argument Issues** (TC008)
   - `validate:story` requires a file path argument but test doesn't provide one

3. **Timeout Issues** (TC009, TC010)
   - Orchestrator commands hang waiting for user input
   - Need non-interactive flags or mock inputs

### 3. Infrastructure Dependencies

1. **Qdrant Service** (TC004, TC025)
   - Tests requiring Qdrant vector database were skipped
   - Would need local Qdrant instance running for these tests

2. **Missing Test Definitions** (TC011, TC013, TC014)
   - Three tests have no commands specified in the test plan

### Timeout Tests (2) ⏱️

| Test ID | Title | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| TC009 | Enhanced Workflow Orchestrator Verbosity | Command requires user interaction |
| TC010 | Dev-QA Iterative Workflow Option | Command requires user interaction |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Add Missing npm Scripts**
   - Review package.json and add the 12 missing script definitions
   - Ensure scripts point to valid JavaScript files

2. **Fix Interactive Commands**
   - Add non-interactive flags to orchestrator commands
   - Implement `--non-interactive` or similar options

3. **Update Test Plan**
   - Add command definitions for TC011, TC013, TC014
   - Provide required arguments for commands that need them

### Future Improvements

1. **Qdrant Integration**
   - Document how to set up local Qdrant instance
   - Add setup instructions to test documentation

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Current working features represent only 31% of planned functionality
   - Focus on implementing missing features to achieve full coverage

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages for missing scripts
   - Add validation for required command arguments

## Test Execution Log

Full test execution details are available in:
- Test results: `testsprite_tests/tmp/test_results.json`
- Execution log: `testsprite_tests/test-execution.log`

## Conclusion

While the core validation and build systems are functioning well, significant work is needed to implement the missing npm scripts and handle interactive commands properly. The test suite has successfully identified gaps between the documented functionality and actual implementation, providing a clear roadmap for completion.

The 31% success rate indicates that approximately one-third of the planned CLI functionality is currently operational, with the remaining features either missing or requiring fixes to work correctly in an automated testing environment.
