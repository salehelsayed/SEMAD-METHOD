# 1. Executive Summary


SEMAD-METHOD is an enhanced fork of BMAD-METHOD that introduces structured, schema-driven workflows to minimize AI hallucination and improve code quality in AI-assisted software development. By converting free-form instructions to YAML/JSON schemas, implementing working memory systems, and establishing formal contracts between planning and implementation phases, SEMAD-METHOD ensures deterministic, traceable, and high-quality code generation.
