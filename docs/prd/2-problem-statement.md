# 2. Problem Statement


### Current Challenges with BMAD-METHOD

1. **Free-form Instructions**: Markdown-based tasks and checklists force LLMs to infer structure, leading to misinterpretation
2. **Context Loss**: Agents lack persistent memory between tasks, causing information drift
3. **Hallucination Risk**: Prose-based summaries between PRD and story creation introduce interpretation errors
4. **Monolithic Task Processing**: Large tasks are processed as single units without systematic decomposition
5. **Validation Gaps**: No automated validation between planning artifacts and implementation
6. **Workflow Rigidity**: Fixed linear workflows without options for iterative development
7. **User Input Loss**: Workflows proceeding without capturing critical user decisions
8. **Role Confusion**: Agents performing tasks outside their designated responsibilities
9. **Path Inconsistencies**: Hardcoded paths not matching actual file locations
10. **Limited Visibility**: Insufficient feedback about system operations

### Impact
- Inconsistent code quality
- Implementation drift from original requirements
- Increased debugging and rework cycles
- Reduced developer confidence in AI-generated code
