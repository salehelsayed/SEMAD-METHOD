# Story AH-007: Deterministic Templates & Low-Temperature Generation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a Dev agent, I want deterministic templates and low-randomness generation settings so outputs are predictable and consistently structured.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Story, test, and doc templates include placeholders for `storyId`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `pre/postConditions`, and traceability markers.
2. A generation config sets low temperature and fixed seeds where applicable.
3. Documentation outlines deterministic practices and when to deviate.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update templates (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add explicit fields and comments in templates
- [ ] Add generation config (AC: 2)
  - [ ] `scripts/generation/config.json` with model/temperature/seed
- [ ] Documentation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update `docs/GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md`

## Dev Notes
Integrate with AH-005â€™s patch plan to include template references.
