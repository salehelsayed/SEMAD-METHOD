# Story AH-008: Type-First Enforcement

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a Dev team, I want type checks to block merges so type errors cannot slip through and mislead downstream agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `npm run type:check` runs the projectâ€™s type checker(s) and exits non-zero on error.
2. `preflight:all` includes type checks.
3. Policy documented and referenced by orchestrator gates.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement scripts (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `type:check` to `package.json` using `tsc -p . --noEmit` (or project default)
- [ ] Integrate preflight (AC: 2)
- [ ] Update docs (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes
Honor monorepo packages if present.
