## üîß Technical Architecture

### Qdrant Schema Design

```javascript
// Dependency Collection: 'bmad_code_dependencies'
{
  id: "md5_hash_of_file:symbol",
  vector: [384_dimensional_embedding],
  payload: {
    symbolName: "function/class/variable name",
    symbolType: "function|class|method|variable|import|export", 
    filePath: "relative/path/from/repo/root",
    lineNumber: 42,
    dependencies: ["array", "of", "dependency", "identifiers"],
    dependents: ["array", "of", "dependent", "identifiers"], 
    scope: "global|local|module",
    signature: "full function/class signature",
    description: "auto-generated description for embedding",
    lastModified: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    fileHash: "md5_hash_of_file_content"
  }
}
```

### Language Support

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Functions, arrow functions, classes, methods, variables, imports/exports
- **Python**: Functions, classes, variables, import statements
- **Java**: Classes, methods, variables, import statements
- **Extensible**: Architecture supports adding new language parsers
