# QA Review-Only Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Story 6 - preventing the QA agent from implementing changes and ensuring they only review code and provide feedback.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. QA Agent Configuration (`/bmad-core/agents/qa.md`)
- Updated persona role from "Senior Developer & Test Architect" to "Senior Code Reviewer & Test Architect"
- Changed style to include "advisory" instead of active implementation
- Modified core principles:
  - Added "Review-Only Mandate" as first principle
  - Changed "Active Refactoring" to "Advisory Role"
  - Updated all action-oriented principles to review/assessment focus
- Updated `whenToUse` to emphasize review and advisory feedback

### 2. Review Story Task (`/bmad-core/structured-tasks/review-story.yaml`)
- Changed purpose to "Review story implementation and provide advisory feedback for Dev agent"
- Modified QA Results template:
  - "Refactoring Performed" → "Recommended Refactoring"
  - "Improvements Checklist" now states all items remain unchecked for Dev
  - Removed pre-checked [x] examples, all items now show as [ ]
  - Updated security and performance sections to indicate "recommendations for Dev agent"
  - Changed final status to include "Needs Fixes - Dev agent should address items above"
- Updated notes to use "recommend" instead of "add" for missing tests

### 3. Workflow Orchestrator (`/tools/workflow-orchestrator.js`)
- Updated linear flow to clarify QA findings need Dev agent attention
- Modified iterative flow messages:
  - "Dev agent addressing QA feedback" → "Dev agent implementing QA recommendations"
  - QA findings described as "recommendations" rather than "issues"
  - Added clarification that Dev agent implements recommendations in next iteration

### 4. Agent Simulator (`/bmad-core/utils/agent-simulator.js`)
- Added comprehensive report structure to QA results:
  - Status: "Approved" or "Needs Fixes"
  - Summary of findings
  - Recommendations array with priority levels
- Added `getIssuePriority` method to categorize issues
- Updated comments to emphasize "Review only, no implementation"

### 5. Handoff Mechanism
Created two new files for QA→Dev handoff:

#### `/bmad-core/templates/qa-dev-handoff-tmpl.yaml`
- Comprehensive template for QA to Dev handoff
- Sections for required changes, test recommendations, architecture concerns
- Clear implementation notes and success criteria
- All focused on Dev agent implementing the changes

#### `/bmad-core/structured-tasks/qa-dev-handoff.yaml`
- Structured task for executing the handoff
- Steps include preparing document, updating story status, creating task list
- Emphasizes no code modifications by QA agent

### 6. Story Template Update (`/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`)
- Added "Needs Fixes" to status choices
- Added qa-agent to status field editors (alongside scrum-master and dev-agent)

### 7. Test Implementation (`/test-qa-review-flow.js`)
- Created comprehensive test script to verify:
  - QA provides feedback without implementing changes
  - Linear and iterative flows work correctly
  - Configuration files contain correct review-only language
  - Handoff mechanism exists

## Key Behavioral Changes

1. **QA Agent Role**: Now purely advisory, identifies issues and provides recommendations
2. **Dev Agent Role**: Receives QA feedback and implements all fixes
3. **Story Flow**: QA can set status to "Needs Fixes" but cannot modify code
4. **Handoff Process**: Clear structured handoff from QA to Dev with actionable items
5. **Iteration Support**: In iterative mode, Dev implements QA recommendations in each cycle

## Testing Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✓ QA agent configured for review-only mode
- ✓ QA agent has advisory role defined
- ✓ Review task uses "Recommended" instead of "Performed"
- ✓ Review task does not pre-check completed items
- ✓ QA→Dev handoff template exists
- ✓ QA→Dev handoff task defined

## Usage
The system now ensures:
1. QA tasks produce a review report without modifying repository files
2. When code changes are needed, the system loops back to the Dev agent
3. QA can update story status to "Done" or "Needs Fixes" but not commit code changes
